**Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen** (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his work with the E Street Band. 
Nicknamed "The Boss", he is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, his Jersey Shore roots, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and 
energetic stage performances.

Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. 
His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984) find pleasures in the struggles of daily American life. 
He has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's 
best-selling artists of all time. 
He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, a Tony Award 
(for Springsteen on Broadway) as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999. 
In 2009, Springsteen was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient, in 2013 was named MusiCares person of the year, and in 2016 was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom.[3]

Springsteen married Patti Scialfa in 1991. Their three children are Evan James Springsteen, Jessica Rae Springsteen, and Sam Ryan Springsteen.

## Early life

Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey. 
He was brought home from the hospital to Freehold Borough where he spent his childhood. He lived on South Street and attended Freehold 
Borough High School. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry, and worked as a bus driver, among other vocations, 
but was unemployed most of the time. Springsteen said his mother, Adele Ann (née Zerilli), a legal secretary and of Italian ancestry, 
was the main breadwinner. His maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense, a town near Naples. He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. 
Pamela had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full-time; she took photos for his Human Touch, Lucky Town and 
The Ghost of Tom Joad albums.

Springsteen's last name is topographic and of Dutch origin, literally translating to "jumping stone" but more generally meaning a kind of stone 
used as a stepping stone in unpaved streets or between two houses. The Springsteens are among the early Dutch families who settled in the 
colony of New Netherland in the 1600s.

Raised a Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns and rejected 
the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and includes a few rock-influenced, 
traditional Irish-Catholic hymns. In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology 
that most influenced his music. He noted in the interview that his faith had given him a "very active spiritual life", although he joked 
that this "made it very difficult sexually." He added: "Once a Catholic, always a Catholic."

In the ninth grade, Springsteen transferred to the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. Former teachers 
have said he was a "loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar." He completed high school, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped 
his own graduation ceremony in 1967. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out.
